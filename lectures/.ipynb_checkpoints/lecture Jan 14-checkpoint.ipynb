       "'it is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families  that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters  my dear mr  bennet   said his lady to him one day   have you heard that netherfield park is let at last  mr  bennet replied that he had not  but it is   returned she   for mrs  long has just been here  and she told me all about it  mr  bennet made no answer  do you not want to know who has taken it   cried his wife impatiently  you want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it  this was invitation enough  why  my dear  you must know  mrs  long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england  that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place  and was so much delighted with it  that he agreed with mr  morris immediately  that he is to take possession before michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week   what is his name   bingley   is he married or single   oh  single  my dear  to be sure  a single man of large fortune  four or five thousand a year  what a fine thing for our girls   how so  how can it affect them   my dear mr  bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so tiresome  you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them   is that his design in settling here   design  nonsense  how can you talk so  but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them  and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes   i see no occasion for that  you and the girls may go  or you may send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for as you are as handsome as any of them  mr  bingley may like you the best of the party   my dear  you flatter me  i certainly have had my share of beauty  but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now  when a woman has five grown up daughters  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty   in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of   but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr  bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood   it is more than i engage for  i assure you   but consider your daughters  only think what an establishment it would be for one of them  sir william and lady lucas are determined to go  merely on that account  for in general  you know  they visit no newcomers  indeed you must go  for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not   you are over scrupulous  surely  i dare say mr  bingley will be very glad to see you  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls  though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy   i desire you will do no such thing  lizzy is not a bit better than the others  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane  nor half so good humoured as lydia  but you are always giving her the preference   they have none of them much to recommend them   replied he   they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters   mr  bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way  you take delight in vexing me  you have no compassion for my poor nerves   you mistake me  my dear  i have a high respect for your nerves  they are my old friends  i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least   ah  you do not know what i suffer   but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood   it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you will not visit them   depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will visit them all  mr  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour  reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character  her mind was less difficult to develop  she was a woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain temper  when she was discontented  she fancied herself nervous  the business of her life was to get her daughters married  its solace was visiting and news  '"
